If the minimum odds\/probable payoff criteria (as defined by the player) are satisfied at the scheduled timeframe, the bet is sent to tote for processing. Otherwise, the conditional wager \u0027fails\u0027 and no bet is placed. Conditional wagers are currently available for Win, Daily Double, Exacta, and Quinella wagers. Conditional \u0027Win\u0027 wagers are restricted to bets involving a single betting interest. Conditional \u0027Exacta\u0027, \u0027Quinella\u0027, or \u0027Daily Double\u0027 wagers are restricted to a single (\u0027straight\u0027) combination consisting of exactly two betting interests. Account balances are not debited until the conditional wager has been successfully accepted by tote. In the event your account balance does not have the funds needed when being processed by tote, the wager will \u0027fail\u0027.
