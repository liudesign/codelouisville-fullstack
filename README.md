#Code Louisville Fullstack Project

This project was created with the [Angular Full-Stack Generator](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack) version 4.1.0.

Project is a test prototype for feature in Twin Spires' v.next webapp, a registration flows using the fullstack technology. Allows user to register and create account on Twin Spires.


###The tech stacks

- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) Tasks runner to automate the build and development
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) Scaffolding generator that spins up a project quickly with basic parts of a web app
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) - Keep a running daemon with `mongod`
- [ExpressJS](https://nodejs.org) Simplify the web's backend including easier route creation
- [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) A complex Javascript framework that extends HTML's limitations. It's HTML on steroids, providing a lot of functionalities out of the box, including two-way data binding, client-side validations with just a few lines of code. Can be used with other Javascript framework or library.
- [Node.js and npm](nodejs.org) NodeJS and NPM allows Javascript dev to get their hands on backend control

### How to run app

1. Run `npm install` to install server dependencies.

2. Run `mongod` in a separate shell to keep an instance of the MongoDB Daemon running

3. Run `gulp serve` to start the development server. It should open the client in your browser when ready.
