I feel that is a term handicappers should eliminate from their vocabulary. If you like the horse, you like the horse.  We all know by playing vertical tickets any day, you will need to spread.  However, if a horse happens to be a price, never tell your audience you like the horse because of the price..',

I never dismiss a horse because of odds once I honestly handicap the race, however I do adjust my betting amount accordingly on that same horse depending on the odds.  Example - there are those who may like "Beholder" in the Distaff, but will only bet her at a certain price and not as the favorite.',
